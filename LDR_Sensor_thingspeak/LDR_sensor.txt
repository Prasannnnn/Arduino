Components Needed
ESP32
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
10kΩ Resistor
Breadboard and Wires
Wiring for LDR
Connect one end of the LDR to the 3.3V pin of the ESP32.
Connect the other end of the LDR to one end of the 10kΩ resistor and the analog input pin (e.g., GPIO34) of the ESP32.
Connect the other end of the 10kΩ resistor to GND.
