Components Needed
ESP32
DHT11
10kÎ© Resistor
Breadboard and Wires
Wiring for LDR
Hardware Setup
DHT11 Sensor:
VCC: Connect to the 3.3V pin of the ESP32.
GND: Connect to the GND pin of the ESP32.
Data: Connect to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO4) of the ESP32.
Pull-up Resistor (Optional but recommended): Place a 10kÎ© resistor between the Data pin and VCC.
2. Installing Required Libraries
Make sure you have installed the "DHT sensor library" and "Adafruit Unified Sensor" library in your Arduino IDE. You can do this via the Library Manager (Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries).
